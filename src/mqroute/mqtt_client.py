        The `subscribe` method facilitates MQTT topic subscription by allowing the user to create
        a decorator that processes incoming messages before invoking the decorated function.
        It provides the option to automatically convert JSON payloads to Python dictionaries.
        It also registers the callback to the specified topic and subscribes to it with the
        desired Quality of Service (QoS) level.

        Standard MQTT wildcards are supported:
           - "#" matches any topics under the current level, including multilevel matches.
           - "+" matches exactly one level.
           - If there is a need to capture the value of single level wildcard matched
             by + a parameter can be created. This is achieved by using - instead of
             single + as MQTT standard - syntax like +<parameter_name>+
             The CallbackResolver will then create a parameter <parameter_name> that is
             assigned with value found in the matched topic.
